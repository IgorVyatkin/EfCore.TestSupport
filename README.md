# EfCore.TestSupport

This NuGet package containing methods to help you unit test applications that use [Entity Framework Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/index) for database access. This readme provides links to the documentation in the [EfCore.TestSupport wiki](https://github.com/JonPSmith/EfCore.TestSupport/wiki). Also see [Release Notes](https://github.com/JonPSmith/EfCore.TestSupport/blob/master/ReleaseNotes.md) for information on changes.

**NOTE:** *The first number in the version number of this library defines what version of EF Core it works for. e.g. EfCore.TestSupport version 5 is works with to EF Core 5. If are using the older versions of EF Core you need [EfCore.TestSupport, version 3.2.0](https://www.nuget.org/packages/EfCore.TestSupport/3.2.0).*

**WARNING: If you are updating from the original EfCore.TestSupport (2.1 or 3), then you should read the [Version5UpgradeDocs.md](https://github.com/JonPSmith/EfCore.TestSupport/blob/master/Version5UpgradeDocs.md) file as there are some breaking changes in this version.**

This project is open-source (MIT licence).
